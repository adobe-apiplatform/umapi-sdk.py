# umapi-sdk

Developer toolkit for use of the [User Management API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/usermanagement/docs/gettingstarted.html) from Adobe.

This SDK is intended for developers who want to roll their own user management tooling using any combination of client-side tools.  If you are a system administrator who is trying to get started with user management in the Adobe Admin Console, and would rather not do your own development, you should probably check out the [User Sync Tool](https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/user-sync.py).  If you are a Python developer, you can bootstrap your work with the [Python UMAPI client](https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/umapi-client.py).
